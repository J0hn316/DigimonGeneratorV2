## Digimon Generator V2

## Introduction
Welcome to the Digimon Generator V2 This app allows you to create, view, edit, and delete custom Pokémon cards. You can search for your favorite Pokémon, generate their card, and explore various features. This is my second attempt of making a pokemon card app.
My first attempt was made during my days in a Programming BootCamp with PerScholas using just React and a API. Link to that project is - https://github.com/J0hn316/DigimonGenerator


## Built using the following Technologies:

- React, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript

# List of Digimon

It turns out this API can not find All the Digimon from the Digital Universe.
Here is the link to a List of Digimon that can be found using this API
